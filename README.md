# accept-membership-invitation-vue
Simple Vue component for accepting invitation to the Deo et Orbi app membership.

1. Admin generates personalized invitation link using https://github.com/Deo-et-Orbi/invite-to-membership-vue (most probably at https://deoetorbi.com/zapraszamy-czlonkow/)
2. User uses the link to access invite accept page
3. User logs in — the act of logging in connects the account with the invitation — thus membership is granted automatically
4. User downloads the app and logs in smoothly
